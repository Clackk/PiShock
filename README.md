# PiShock
A PiShock API integration for Swiss (and other Red-DiscordBot architectures


It has not been tested yet, but these are just some fun pishock commands for fun discord voice chats n whatnot.
will update to be more in depth later

PLEASE NOTE
This integration is as of yet untested until I can get my hands on a device, which hopefully will occur here soon. So please bear with me, or feel free to test yourself and let me know how it goes.
